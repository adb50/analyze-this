## Repurposing Travel Lanes for Multimodal Projects

*Andy Nash, Green City Streets with Natalie Stiffler, City of Boulder*

One of the many challenges associated with many sidewalk widening, bike lane, and transit lane projects is drivers’ and businesses’ concern for the potential of  increased congestion.  Using the City of Boulder’s recent Folsom Street Living Lab project as a case study, this group will devise a plan to evaluate the potential congestion impacts of reallocating roadway space.

## Incorporating Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (C/AV) Technologies into the City of Edmonton Regional Travel Demand Model

*Erin Toop, City of Edmonton*

Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (C/AV) technology will have drastic effects on our current mobility systems, impacting all transportation users whether or not they adopt the technology.  Like many others, the City of Edmonton does not currently have an approach to accounting for this technology in their travel behavior models or the analysis that uses them.  This group will develop a approach to account for C/AVs in the travel analysis methods of the City of Edmonton.
