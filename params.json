{"name":"Analyze This!","tagline":"A 2016 TRB Annual Meeting Workshop that puts timely planning problems in front of willing teams of analysts to come up with solutions","body":"## The Objective\r\nHave an interactive workshop where we:\r\n(A) Get some great minds to think about how to analyze the tough planning questions of today \r\n(B) Give analysts an opportunity to learn about how their peers think and approach problem-solving, and \r\n(C) Highlight areas where further research is needed to be helpful to the planning community\r\n\r\n## The Summary\r\nThis workshop presents analysts and modelers with three different real-life problems that planners are wondering how to analyze.  Three planners will be recruited who have interesting problems and questions to “ask” the analysis/modeling community.  These “planning case studies” will be shared via online listservs prior to the meeting and presented at the beginning of the workshop.  At the workshop, you will Work in small teams and come up with an analysis strategy to answer the planners’ questions and have an opportunity to present it to the group and discuss its merits and drawbacks.  \r\n\r\n## Who?\r\n**Planners:**  We are currently recruiting three planners who have interesting problems and questions to “ask” the analysis/modeling community.  \r\n**Analysts:**  Be on the lookout for the selected case studies to be distributed via the TMIP list-serve in the lead-up to the conference.  And then all you have to do is *show up to TRB and attend the workshop!*\r\n**Researchers:**  Come to the workshop and learn about what gaps exist in research to get planners the answers to their questions.\r\n**Students:** Please let me know if you would like to volunteer to be a scribe or helper for this session.\r\n\r\n### Who is in charge?\r\nThis workshop is a production of ADB50, the TRB Standing Committee on Planning Applications.\r\nThe following committees are acting as co-sponsors to help us both source/recruit interesting problems/qualified analysts:\r\n\r\n * **ADB40** Travel Demand Modeling\r\n * **AP025** Public Transportation Planning\r\n * **ABE50** Transportation Demand Management\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
