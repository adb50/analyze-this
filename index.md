# Analyze This!  Three Unsolved Planning Mysteries

**WANTED**: Planning mystery detectives of all types including planners, engineers, analysts, modelers, psychologists, researchers, + pedestrians.

**Report in person to:**  Workshop #114  Sunday, January 10, 2016  •  9 AM – 12 PM  •  TRB

**Discuss online:** Here, when the individual mysteries are announced, or on Twitter [#trbanalyzethis](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&q=%23trbanalyzethis&src=typd)

Our world is changing and so are the questions being asked by companies, planners, and decision-makers.  Help us solve some of the newly released planning mysteries on the non-fiction best seller list by participating in “Analyze This!” an interactive  TRB workshop.  

We selected three problems from dozens of submissions that range from corporate, local, and regional in scope and require a diversity of expertise to solve.  Working in small, problem specific teams, workshop participants will develop a strategy to share with the audience, compare and evaluate their peers, and then collectively develop some next steps and potential research directions.

**Stay tuned, the first mystery will be unveiled on Mystery Monday, December 7th!**
