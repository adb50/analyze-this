# The Workshop
Four standing committees of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) are coming together 
to sponsor a new type of interactive workshop for the 2016 Annual Meeting.  The “Analyze 
This! What Planners Want to Know” workshop will present three intriguing, 
real-world problems faced by those in the transportation industry.  Working in small teams, 
participants will come up with a strategy to address each problem and to share and learn 
amongst their peers.  This workshop is intended to:  
(A) get creative minds to assess the tough planning questions of today,  
(B) provide an opportunity to learn how others approach problem solving, and  
(C) highlight areas where further research can improve the planning process.

# Call for Problem Statements - October 1st Deadline!

Three ideas for problems will be selected from a pool of submissions before the workshop.  These 
ideas should summarize a case study from the perspective of an individual or project team.  The 
case studies should contain pertinent information on the type of problem presented, geographic 
context, who was impacted, and the impact of not reaching a resolution.  All three problems 
will be shared online before the Annual Meeting so that participants have a chance to see what 
will be discussed.  **Those who submit ideas that are selected will be provided the opportunity 
to present their problem at the TRB Annual Meeting.**

The four sponsoring TRB Committees are asking members of the greater transportation 
community to submit problem ideas that will be used as case studies during the workshop.
  Submissions will be reviewed by members and friends of the sponsoring committees.  Those 
who submit problems will be notified by October 15, 2015 if their idea was selected.  

**Please submit an idea using the** [online form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19cytWbKCIrQpjir5Ie6vuu64XCzRX8uD60yPvJy8C14/viewform) 
**by October 1st 2015 in order to be considered for the 2016 TRB Annual Meeting.**


# Who?

**Planners**: We are currently recruiting three planners who have interesting problems and 
questions to “ask” the analysis/modeling community.  **[Submit your problem 
statements](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/19cytWbKCIrQpjir5Ie6vuu64XCzRX8uD60yPvJy8C14/viewform) by October 1st in order to be considered**  
**Analysts**: Be on the lookout for the selected case studies to be distributed via the 
TMIP list-serve in the lead-up to the conference. And then all you have to do is show up 
to TRB and attend the workshop! Researchers: Come to the workshop and learn about what gaps 
exist in research to get planners the answers to their questions.   
**Students**: Please let us know if you would like to volunteer to be a scribe or helper for this session.

# When?

The Analyze This workshop is scheduled to be from 9:00 AM - Noon on Sunday January 10th at the
