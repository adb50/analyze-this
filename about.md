# The Workshop

Four standing committees of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) are coming together
to sponsor a new type of interactive workshop for the 2016 Annual Meeting.  The “Analyze
This! What Planners Want to Know” workshop will present three intriguing,
real-world problems faced by those in the transportation industry.  Working in small teams,
participants will come up with a strategy to address each problem and to share and learn
amongst their peers.  This workshop is intended to:  
(A) get creative minds to assess the tough planning questions of today,  
(B) provide an opportunity to learn how others approach problem solving, and  
(C) highlight areas where further research can improve the planning process.
