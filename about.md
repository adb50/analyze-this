# The Workshop

Six standing committees of the Transportation Research Board (TRB) are coming together to sponsor a new type of interactive workshop for the 2017 Annual Meeting. The workshop entitled, “Analyze This! What YOU Want to Know” will present three intriguing, real-world problems faced by planners in the transportation industry. Working in small teams, participants will come up with strategies to address each problem and to share and learn amongst their peers. This workshop is intended to:
amongst their peers.  This workshop is intended to:  
(A) create an atmosphere where people with diverse backgrounds and skills interact and share ideas  
(B) enable discussion of various approaches with a definite application but without a foregone conclusion
(C) highlight areas where further research is needed to be helpful to the planning community

# Workshop Details

Three hard-to-solve problems will be selected from a pool of submissions before the workshop. These real-world problems should summarize a case study from the perspective of an individual or project team. The case studies should contain pertinent information on the type of problem presented, geographic context, who was impacted, and the impact of not reaching a resolution. All three problems will be shared on-line before the Annual Meeting so that participants have a chance to see what will be discussed. The authors of the problems selected will be provided the opportunity to present their problem at the TRB Annual Meeting.

# Problem Idea Submission

The workshop is scheduled for 9 AM – 12 PM on the morning of Sunday, January 8, 2017 during the TRB Annual Meeting. The six sponsoring TRB Committees are asking members of the greater transportation community to submit problem ideas that will be used as case studies during the workshop. Submissions will be reviewed by members and friends of the sponsoring committees. Deadline for submission is October 1, 2016. Please submit an idea using the on-line form located here.	Selected problem ideas will be notified by October 15, 2016.
