# Incorporating Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (C/AV) Technologies into the City of Edmonton Regional Travel Demand Model

*Erin Toop, City of Edmonton*

Connected and Autonomous Vehicle (C/AV) technology will have drastic effects on our current mobility systems, impacting all transportation users whether or not they adopt the technology.

This group will develop a approach to account for C/AVs in the travel analysis methods of the City of Edmonton.
